# Robust-control-of-AVR
In this study, novel controllers utilizing H∞ and structured singular value decomposition has been introduced to enhance the robustness of the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system. The controller accounts for six distinct uncertainties in the actuator, exciter, and generator, which manifest as variations in linear transfer functions due to load fluctuations and aging effects over time. The effectiveness of this approach hinges on two key factors. Firstly, it simultaneously addresses output disturbances, sensor noise, and system uncertainties during the controller design process. Secondly, it incorporates a non-conservative modeling approach for all six structured parameters within the required µ-synthesis P −∆−K configuration. Through suboptimal H∞ control design and µ-analysis theorem and   μ-synthesis control design, a single-input, single-output (SISO) controller is derived, resulting in a closed-loop system where µ<1 is achieved.
